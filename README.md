This file is of no use.

It was created because I wanted it so, you can read it to understand what a bad programmer I am.

You also need sqlite3.exe in the same repo to work with it:

-exe of this file(you no need to download sqlite3)
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RGjjQhphg3LlAMSpNnlkhjNXQ3ScOK2H/view?usp=sharing

-exe of sqlite3 
https://www.sqlite.org/download.html

only works with windows because of how does the file work
